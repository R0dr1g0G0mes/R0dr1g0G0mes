My name is Rodrigo Gomes, and I'm a 22-year-old student at the University of Beira Interior. I began my programming journey in 2020 while pursuing a degree in Web Informatics. Since then, I have continuously honed my skills in Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, and various other tools.

The University of Beira Interior has provided me with a diverse and stimulating environment that has fueled my passion for learning and personal growth. I am committed to quickly mastering new concepts in the field of technology.
